# Machine Learning Basics
Basics for Machine Learning

# About
This repository contains python implementations of some of the fundamental Machine Learning models and algorithms based off of Erik Linder-Noren's post. 

Note, the purpose of this is not to produce as optimized and computationally efficient algorithms as possible,
but rather to present the inner workings of them in a clear and accessible way.

# Resouces
Added in lots of resource for learning Machine Learning
